NOTE:
  This implementation assumes you (the user) will pass a txt file as input
  and that inside of that file there will be space-separated integer values.
  If you do not pass an input file as a command line argument, you will need to
  insert your values manually using the (i) menu command.
  Please ensure the input file is in the project directory.
